# The-Parental-Control-System
This project proposes a novel approach to parental control systems by integrating keylogger and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
In this project, we developed a platform which consists of  a user-friendly UI and dataset for NLP summarization. 
The system records keystrokes made by children on various platforms and applications, and then utilizes NLP to analyze 
and extract meaningful information from the recorded data. It identifies potentially harmful or inappropriate content, 
such as cyberbullying or explicit language, and categorizes and flags it accurately using machine learning algorithms. 
Privacy and data security are ensured through encryption techniques. 
Parents have access to a user-friendly dashboard where they can review summarized reports and receive Mails through SMTP. 
They can also set customized rules and restrictions. 
The proposed system aims to empower parents with a comprehensive tool that promotes responsible internet usage and enhances parental guidance in the digital age.
The result declares that keylogging can be used in a legal way.
